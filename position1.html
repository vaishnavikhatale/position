         Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, 
        built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox. Versions were later released for Linux, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, 
        and also for Android, where it is the default browser.</p>
        <p>
            By building a Chrome App, as opposed to going with a traditional web app or a native mobile app,
             you expand your potential audience and extend your development capability.</p>
        <p> 
            might be thinking, "If I write a standard web application, I can run it on any platform that has a web browser." Of course, 
             this is absolutely right, but remember that Chrome Apps extend your development capacity beyond what you can do with traditional
             web apps:</p>
        <p>
            Chrome Apps can integrate seamlessly into the desktop and look more like desktop applications than traditional web apps.
             Chrome Apps for Desktop have no omnibox (address bar) and tab strip like normal browser-based apps, because like native desktop apps, they don't live in a browser.</p>
        <p>
            Chrome App TheLauncher makes it easy for users to find and start your Chrome App.
             OS X users can use the integrated spotlight search to find and start your app.
            Chrome Apps for Desktop</p>
        <p>
            The cross platform nature of Chrome Apps makes writing device drivers less painful. 
            A device manufacturer only needs to write one application for configuring their device and it will run on any device.</p>

            Google Chrome is a freeware web browser made by Google. It builds on parts from other open source software, including WebKit
            and Mozilla Firefox. The name comes from the graphical user interface frame, or "chrome", of web browsers. 
            The open source project behind Google Chrome is known as Chromium.</p>
        <p>
            Google Chrome features a minimalistic user interface, with its user-interface principles later being implemented into other browsers. 
             For example, the merging of the address bar and search bar into the omnibox or omnibar Chrom
            also has a reputation for strong browser performance. </p>
        <p>
            It is essential in a diverse range of applications from enabling a hygienic, safe and durable finish in thousands of everyday items,
            to its use in critical infrastructure and role as a dietary supplement. Chrome is added to molten iron to provide a range
             of speciality alloys.
